# 🧠⚖️ Conscience.ai – What If AI Had a Moral Compass?

**Conscience.ai** is an interactive, emotion-driven web app that simulates how different AI personalities handle moral decisions — and compares their logic with your human conscience.

Built using Python and Streamlit, this project invites users to explore real-world dilemmas through the minds of:
- 🚀 **Elon AI** – Bold, profit-focused, risk-tolerant
- 🧘 **Zen Monk AI** – Compassionate, non-violent, principle-first
- 🧠 **Your Human Response** – You decide what’s truly ethical

---

## 🎯 Use Case

Imagine you're the CEO facing this dilemma:
> "Should we lay off 1000 employees to invest in AI innovation?"

With Conscience.ai, you:
1. Select the scenario
2. Choose AI personalities
3. Type your own human decision
4. Instantly see a radar chart comparing logic, empathy, and risk between you and the AIs

## 🌟 Why This Project Stands Out

✅ **Emotion + AI** in one dashboard  
✅ AI personas with moral styles (first-of-its-kind!)  
✅ Compares machine thinking vs human conscience  
✅ Visually impactful and demo-worthy  
✅ Creative, ethical, and future-relevant

## 🧪 Example Output

> *“I would delay executive bonuses and redirect funds to innovation. Layoffs should be the last resort. People aren't cost units — they're the soul of the company.”*  
> — *Your Human Conscience*

## 🤯 Future Ideas

- Add more personas (Investor AI, Humanitarian AI, etc.)
- Let users build their own moral personality
- Predict how each AI would evolve over time
